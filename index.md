Digital Quarantine
===================

A Swift based macOS application aimed at digital wellbeing, especially to prevent Computer Vision Syndrome 


## 20-20-20 rule: 
#### Every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds.

### Does it work?

### How do we achieve it?
Digital Quarantine uses an aggressive approach to prevent you from staring at the screen for prolonged duration.

An empty screen overlays the entire screen based on the duration configured. Don't worry, the app gives a heads-up before the black out, so you have time to brace for impact.

Whenever the screen blacks-out, get out of wherever you are, do a few stretches, look through the window, talk to someone or do anything that does not involve a digital screen. And definitely have a sip of water.

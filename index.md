Digital Quarantine
===================

A Swift based macOS application aimed at digital wellbeing, especially to prevent [Computer Vision Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision_syndrome).

## 20-20-20 rule: 
<b> Every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds. </b>

### Does it work?

### How do we achieve it?
Digital Quarantine uses an aggressive approach to prevent you from staring at the screen for prolonged duration.

As shown above, the app sets the brightness to zero periodically for a fixed interval. Don't worry, the app gives a heads-up before the black out, so you have time to brace for impact.

Whenever the screen blacks-out, get out of wherever you are, do a few stretches, look through the window, talk to someone or do anything that does not involve a digital screen.

## Features
 - Yes, you guessed it right. There is <b>NO quit button</b>. In fact, you'll find it pretty hard to quit this application
 - You can manually override the brightness, BUT DON'T DO IT UNLESS YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT
 - Defaulters are identified and guilted into proper behaviour
 - Tune preferences based on your need. Although, we recommend you set it at 20-20-20
 - App launches automatically after system restart or in case of any crashes due to external factors
 - Support for external monitors

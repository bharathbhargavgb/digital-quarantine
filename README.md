Digital Quarantine
===================

A Swift based macOS application aimed at digital wellbeing, especially to prevent Computer Vision Syndrome 


## 20-20-20 rule: 
#### Every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds.

### Does it work?

### How do we achieve it?
Digital Quarantine uses an aggressive approach to prevent you from staring at the screen for prolonged duration.

An empty screen overlays the entire screen based on the duration configured. Don't worry, the app gives a heads-up before the black out, so you have time to brace for impact.

Whenever the screen blacks-out, get out of wherever you are, do a few stretches, look through the window, talk to someone or do anything that does not involve a digital screen. And definitely have a sip of water. 

## Features
 - Tune preferences based on your need. Although, we recommend you set it at 20-20-20
 - Complete blackout forcing you to look away
 - Subtle headsup for an upcoming break with a temporary status icon change
 - App launches automatically after system restart or in case of any crashes due to external factors
